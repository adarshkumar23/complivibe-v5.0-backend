"""Helpers for turning a derivation-engine ConstraintSpec into the two
provenance-bearing fields persisted on `AiDerivedGuardrail`
(see models and PATENT.md Claim 1: "retaining a reference to its source
obligation record").

Kept separate from `derivation_engine.py` because these functions are purely
about *persistence shape* (dict/list serialization for a JSON column), not
about deriving or compiling policy.

Ported verbatim from P3 `core-side-patch/services/provenance.py` (imports made
package-relative).
